\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing a small dot amongst the stars can bring a sense of awe and wonder, but we\u0027ve always wanted to explore a little more those feelings of fear and dread that come from being alone in the depths of space. Terror in the face of the unknown, or the dawning realisation that you\u0027re treading in the footsteps of those who met a lonely end at the edge of the universe - it\u0027s a rich science fiction tradition, and one not really touched on in No Man\u0027s Sky - until now.  \u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.nomanssky.com\/desolation-update\u0022\u003EDesolation Update\u003C\/a\u003E adds abandoned freighters to explore to No Man\u2019s Sky, along with a very different style of gameplay. Alone or in groups, players can breach the airlock and explore the hazardous, procedurally generated, interiors of these derelict capital ships. The only trace of the crew is in logs they\u2019ve left behind, a mix of procedurally generated and hand-written text that means each vessel has its own unique story for you to piece together.  \u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe shattered interiors are also rich with salvage, including otherwise unobtainable upgrades for your own capital ship. Technology you retrieve still has the marks of the ship you took it from, meaning your own freighter will now reflect something of your journey.  \u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut in the panic to flee the ship, hazardous items have spilled, defense systems have been scrambled and environment controls have begun to fail. Some vessels may even have been overrun by hostile alien lifeforms... You may want to take some friends along to increase your chances of making it out alive.  \u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Desolation update also brings improvements and balance changes to weapons and enemies for a faster, more dynamic combat experience. Weapon balance, effects and feel have been tweaked to provide not just a more engaging combat experience on these alien infested frigates, but across the game as well.  \u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe full patch notes are \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.nomanssky.com\/desolation-update\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C\/a\u003E, and they contain a huge list of quality of life improvements too.  \u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt has been extremely gratifying for us to see a huge number of new players flood into the game since we entered the GamePass program last month. It\u2019s particularly exciting to know that, with the cross-play update, those players were finally able to join friends on other platforms. Unifying our community and all their in-game creations on one network was a phenomenal achievement by our small technical team. It\u2019s been a real surprise too to see No Man\u2019s Sky sitting above the likes of Red Dead as the most played game on GamePass.  \u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs ever, the team has also continued to work on more updates.

A mouse click or button press will dismiss this screen. We have also introduced a new method for mod installation which should prevent player\u0027s games from breaking when a new update is released.

(Note: If you are still being pointed to missing facilities during the NPC questlines, you can either claim a new base and re-build the NPC terminal, or if you have a Freighter, remove the NPC terminal from your base and rebuild it in the Freighter. The NPC should then give you new coordinates. We are still working on a more permanent fix for this issue).\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis update is live now!
